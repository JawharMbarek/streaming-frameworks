\section*{Abstract}
With the tremendous growth of information in various sources such as sensors (RFID) or news sources (RFD newsfeeds)
it is more difficult to query information continously. To clarify the question, which machine is most commonly frequented in a network, supporting systems are beeing necessary. At this point methods in the field of Complex Event Processing (CEP) help to solve this issue. In the special area of stream processing of CEP, streaming frameworks were developed to support and simplify the work of complex queries in a higher abstraction level. This master thesis involves a comaprison between the streaming frameworks: Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, Apache Flume and Apache S4. In the thesis prototypes are developed to capture and to compare measured values.
